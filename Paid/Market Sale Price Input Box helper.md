## How it works?
Whenever user opens the Market Page, the script adds a box which has 2 input boxes, one for setting the price of items and the other for setting the price of points.
User can use these boxes to set the sale price using **k, m and b** shortcut. (I have a free script that provides similar feature for [Bank Page](https://cartelempire.online/Forum/9/254))
