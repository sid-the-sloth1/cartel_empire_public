## How it works?
1. Whenever user opens the Inventory Page, the script caches the items available in the inventory.
2. Then whenever user visits the Market or Jobs Page, it shows the information regarding the raw material the user needs to sustain the production.
3. Whenever user obtains production item either from Market or by successfully completing a job(only if user himself initiates the job and views the success message), the script auto-update its data.
4. The user needs to visit Inventory tab as often as he can to ensure 100% accuracy. (Even if you open it in another tab, the script will auto-update its data on other tabs too)

## Instructions

 - After the payment, I give you a link to the script code.

 - Once you have installed the Tampermonkey, click on Tampermonkey icon > Click on **Create a new script**.

 - Paste the code I have given you and click on File > Save.
 - After that go to [Inventory Page](https://cartelempire.online/Inventory). Let the page load fully so that script can read the data.
 - After that, go to Jobs or Market Page. Click on Settings icon on the interface created by the script.

 - Here set the number of productions you own of each type and click on Save.
 - Once this is done sit back and enjoy. The script will auto-update its data you open Inventory page or get productions item via Market or Jobs (even in another tab). **But the script is only as accurate as often you visit the Inventory.**


## End Words
My personal favourite thing about the script is, any update in script's data reflects on other opened tabs in which script is running. For example: You have jobs page opened and the script is showing you info. Now if you open another tab and in this new tab you go to Market and buy a Fert bag, it will be automatically reflected in info being shown on Jobs page without needing a refresh.

Thing I dislike is, since api is not available, I have to rely on user manually opening the relevant page so script can cache data. This script is only as accurate as often as you visit inventory.
